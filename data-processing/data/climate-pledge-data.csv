The mitigation ambition of 70% reduction in GHG emissions, economy-wide, by 2030 will be complemented, inter alia, by the following strategies and plans:

Support for research and development of renewable energy and energy storage technologies appropriate for SIDS, in particular ocean energy in line with the national strategy to develop its blue economy.

A deliberate focus on using distributed generation (e.g. household solar photovoltaics) to provide modern energy access and build resilience (adaptation co-benefits) for low-income households, with an initial target of retrofitting 3,000 low-income homes with solar PV by 2030 under the Roofs to Reefs Program.

Barbados also has different emission reduction targets based on whether or not they receive international support ( aims for 35% reduction relative to business-as-usual emissions in 2030 without international support (unconditional) and 70% reduction relative to business-as-usual emissions in 2030 conditional upon international support.)","targets also include a lot of mitigation and adaptation dimensions given that Barbados is an island nation with particular vulnerabilities to increased storminess (e,g have a reefs to roofs strategy)

Additionally, an extensive stakeholder consultation process was conducted that included two rounds of dialogues involving close to one hundred participants.""

for measures on the emission scopes: In preparing the NDC update, the scope of the coverage of the NDC has been extended to all categories of anthropogenic emissions in line with paragraph 31(c) by conducting a complete update of the historical energy and waste sectors emissions, as well as improvements in other sectors.

information on the extent to which measures will be applied: Since ratification of the Paris Agreement on 22 April 2016, Barbados has implemented the actions and activities specified in its NDC of 28 September 2015 needed to meet its conditional commitment. The implementation experience with the 2015 NDC has generally been positive:

Decentralized solar PV installations have increased with over 2,000 independent power producers now generating 45 MW of power. Progress has also been made in deploying electric passenger vehicles and public buses (EVs).

The Sustainable Energy Investment Program (SMART FUND II), financed by an Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loan to the government and an investment grant from the European Union Caribbean Investment Facility (EU-CIF) provides financial and technical assistance for the preparation and retrofitting of at least 100 public buildings.

The Deployment of Cleaner Fuels and Renewable Energy project, financed by an IDB loan to the National Petroleum Corporation (NPC) and the Barbados National Oil Company Limited (BNOCL), supports the diversification of the energy mix, energy efficiency measures and the use of renewable energy and storage technology within the premises of the NPC and the BNOCL.

Importantly, in 2020 the first Caribbean Green Climate Fund grant to the Barbados Water Authority (BWA) financed 6.5 MW in solar/gas microturbine capacity. The project is being implemented by the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center (CCCCC) and will contribute to climate change adaptation in the water sector. The project involves a Revolving Adaptation Financing Facility to subsidize water efficiency measures for households, hotels and other businesses.

In 2019, the Fair Trading Commission established feed-in-tariffs (FITs) for renewable energy technologies up to 1 MW, and in 2020, established FITs for RE technologies up to 10 MW to replace a temporary tariff arrangement with the utility and provide stable and predictable price signals to potential investors.

Until 2018, the CHENACT project, initiated by the Caribbean Tourism Organization, the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association and the IDB supported energy audits and efficiency measures in small and medium-sized hotels enabling savings of up to 50% of water usage and 30-50 % of energy bills.

Finally, the government has made a number of policy interventions to further NDC implementation, such as the elimination in 2019 of customs duties on imported systems and equipment linked to renewable energy and the provision of several additional tax incentives.

also demonstration of mitigation ambitiion of 70% reduction in GHG emissions economy wide by 2030 will be complimented by:Support for research and development of renewable energy and energy storage technologies appropriate for SIDS, in particular ocean energy in line with the national strategy to develop its blue economy.

A deliberate focus on using distributed generation (e.g. household solar photovoltaics) to provide modern energy access and build resilience (adaptation co-benefits) for low-income households, with an initial target of retrofitting 3,000 low-income homes with solar PV by 2030 under the Roofs to Reefs Program.

The Government of Barbados will put forward legislation that specifies that all emission reduction or removal units (carbon credits) belong to the Crown, unless otherwise specified. Barbados will allow for the sale of up to 50% of any certified carbon credits generated between the period 2020 and 2030.

carbon removal mechanisms:
Private finance initiatives and partnership options have specific merit. Barbados has been promoting and engaging in the areas of:

Green and blue bonds. The first private green bond was issued in August 2019 by Williams Caribbean Capital (WCC). This BBD 3 million (USD 1.5 million) bond finances solar PV assets.

Debt for Nature Swaps, Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes;

Insurance and disaster clauses;

In July 2021, Canada submitted its updated NDC, where it strengthened its emission reduction target from a 30% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030 to at least 40-45% (Government of Canada, 2021d). The inclusion of the reference to ‘at least’ suggests that Canada may exceed this target. We calculate that this target equates to an emissions level in 2030 of 427-467 MtCO2e once the contribution from its land sector has been excluded.

for historical emissions- whilst not specifically included in the target, the updated NDC claims that ""Canada continually looks for ways to improve its methodologies to account for historical emissions. Adopting future methodological improvements may affect historical emissions, including 2005 emissions. This could indirectly affect the megatonnes of emissions reductions required for Canada to achieve its 2030 target.

The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which received Royal Assent on June 29, 2021, codified the Government of Canada’s commitment for the country to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

This legislation requires the Government of Canada to set national emissions reduction targets at five-year intervals for 2030, 2035, 2040, and 2045, and to develop emission reduction plans for each target as well as explain how each plan would contribute to reaching net-zero in 2050. The Government will engage key stakeholders and partners such as provincial and territorial governments, Indigenous Peoples, and the Net-Zero Advisory Body, among others, in setting these national targets. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified that achieving net-zero emissions by about 2050 and achieving deeper near term emission reductions by 2030 are key to limiting warming to 1.5oC. Reducing Canada’s 2030 emissions by 40-45% below 2005 levels will help preserve the remaining carbon budget and act as an important milestone to 2050. Deep emissions reductions by 2030 are required in order to build the demand and supply for net-zero emissions technologies by 2050.

The independent Net-Zero Advisory Body, an expert advisory panel, is working to recommend pathways for Canada to reach its net-zero by 2050 target. The Advisory Body will also provide advice on emissions reductions milestones leading up to 2050, and identify near-term actions and key building blocks that support this long-term target.

The government is an important player in Canada’s work to reach to net-zero emissions by 2050. Government decisions must consider climate in a rigorous, consistent, and measurable manner. These considerations include both short and long-term climate mitigation, as well as climate resilience and adaptation. This transformation will require an aligned approach that ensures that government spending and decisions support Canada’s climate goals.

Canada will continue to report on its progress through the UNFCCC National Communications every four years and National Inventory Reports every year. Canada will submit its final Biennial Report no later than December 31, 2022. Under the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF), Canada will submit its Biennial Transparency Report by December 31, 2024, and every two years thereafter, in accordance with the modalities, procedures and guidelines (contained in 18/CMA.1) including on progress implementing and achieving its NDC. Furthermore, federal, provincial and territorial governments have committed to jointly report on progress in implementing the PCF through annual PCF synthesis reports available at: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian- framework.html. The Government of Canada will also continue to report on projected emission reductions on an annual basis, and will continue to collaborate with Indigenous Peoples to design indicators that reflect Indigenous climate priorities. The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act requires additional transparency measures including an emissions reduction plan, a progress report and an assessment report for each emissions reduction target it sets, as well as an annual report outlining how the Government of Canada is managing the financial risks and opportunities related to climate change.

Canadas public plan for achieving its targets is outlined in the PCF 
for example includes information like:
Canada is a world leader in zero-carbon power, generating approximately 82% of its electricity from non-emitting sources, such as water, wind, solar and nuclear. Moving forward, emphasis will be placed on ensuring that Canada is prepared for the accelerated electrification of key sectors and can meet increased demand with new sources of non-emitting electricity.

The Government of Canada will:

Require 100 % of new light-duty vehicle and passenger trucks sold in Canada to be zero- emissions by 2035, a commitment supported by pursuing a combination of supportive investments and regulations.

Invest $287 million to extend the Incentives for Zero-Emissions Vehicles program beyond its $300 million initial investment, and invest an additional $150 million in charging and refueling stations across Canada.

Work with partners, domestically and internationally, to reduce emissions from other modes of transportation, which can be challenging to abate, including heavy-duty vehicles, rail, marine, and aviation operations.

Advance the national active transportation strategy by investing $400 million for Canada’s first active transportation fund, drawn from an investment of $14.9 billion for public and active transportation, which also includes $3 billion annually in permanent public transit funding beginning in 2026-27.

Work with the United States to align with the most ambitious light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle standards whether at the state or federal level.

Invest $964 million in smart renewable energy and grid modernization projects, as well as continue to work with provinces and territories to help build key intertie projects.

Commit to powering rural, remote, northern and Indigenous communities that currently rely on diesel with clean, reliable energy by 2030.

The 2020 NDC Target has an unconditional target and a conditional target. 

The unconditional target includes two scopes: 

1) ""Chile commits to a GHG emission budget not exceeding 1,100 MtCO2eq between 2020 and 2030, with a GHG emissions maximum (peak) by 2025, and a GHG emissions level of 95 MtCO2eq by 2030.""

*  The absolute target excludes emissions or removals from the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector.


2) ""Reduce total black carbon emissions by at least 25% by 2030, with respect to 2016 levels.""

The conditional target - depending on international finance: 

""Chile could exceed a 30% reduction, potentially with a reduction of up to 45% in net
emissions by 2030 (including LULUCF), taking into account actions for GHG emissions mitigation and/or capture.""",https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1177286,Not Specified,Yes,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,No,https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/NDC_Update_Chile_PPT_20200409.pdf,Yes,,Less than annual reporting,Yes,,"By 2021: National Landscape Scale Restoration Plan.

","In Sept 2020, President Xi Jinping announced that China would aim to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. China submitted its first long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in October 2021, including the target to become carbon neutral before 2060.

China has been speeding up the process to tackle environmental problems since 2012. There have been 3 main sets of policy actions. The first one was announced in 2013, where the action focused on solving air pollution. The second one was announced in 2017, where the policy is on the industrial side and the capacities of heavy polluted industries such as steel manufacturing were limited. The third one was announced in 2017, where tackling pollution was listed as the 3 main ""battles"" that China will focus on during 2018-2020.

Even though the production of renewable energies has increased steadily, rising energy demand within the country and the widely held belief that fossil fuels go hand in hand with economic development make it difficult to disengage from oil extraction. To restructure the national energy sector, energy governance to ensure the socio-economic sustainability is needed. Thus the social, economic, and environmental impacts must be assessed, and policies developed to meet regional needs. This means, of course, that the acceptance of renewable energies in society must be promoted through economic incentives such as new job opportunities, affordable electricity prices and accessible infrastructure. In addition, it is necessary and to limit damage to flora and fauna caused by renewable energy construction. The switch to cleaner energy sources will entail huge financial and administrative efforts to implement necessary technology, to adjust the existing energy infrastructure and to create institutions to help achieve emission reduction and energy efficiency. Efforts must be made on the national level as well as globally to achieve sustainable development in countries that are trying to balance resource rent dependencies, increasing energy demand, as well as achieving a national energy transition. Global energy policies could consider the needs of these countries and help improve, rather than worsen, already unequal power relations. Combating climate change should be the most important goal on the global agenda, meaning that new policy paths are required which prioritize international cooperation instead of international power struggles. The future should feature new approaches similar to the Yasuní-ITT initiative in Ecuador, which sought international payments for leaving fossil fuels in the ground, thus preserving biodiversity and globally important oxygen sources. Ecuador, like other countries dependent on fossil fuels or coal, must be supported in their quest for clean energy. Without international support, the nations’ access to a green future will be thwarted, aggravating climate change.

In the baseline scenario, it is thought that around 5 MtCO2 in industry per year could be avoided by 2050, and that about 10 MtCO2 of negative emissions could be produced annually thanks to the BECCS. Following the adaptation of the European CCS Directive in 2009, the legislative framework is ready. The use of BECCS will require an adequately centralized use of biomass (in fixed facilities and therefore excluding transport), whereas bio-energy generally is more often used in small facilities in a more scattered way. Rolling out these technologies will benefit from proper integration with the regions’ economies, ideally reusing existing infrastructure and underground storage, offshore if necessary.
Uncertainties regarding these technologies, their acceptability and the availability and reliability of storage mean that their development must be carefully considered and based on the definition of a viable economic model combined with good long-term risk management. That being said, it is most likely that it is an essential option for the future, as it allows for the generation of continuous negative emissions over the very long term (with forest storage eventually reaching an optimum level, draining carbon sinks in a few decades/centuries). Direct capture of CO2 from the atmosphere is also an option, but it is still in the very early stages of research and development.",Climate Ambition Alliance,3.05012E+12,,64531444,,,,,352100000,2019,

This will emerge in the form of 10MW from solar, 15MW from geothermal and 2 MW from wind. Energy efficiency actions to reduce emissions include retrofitting of all buildings (20% reduction), establishment of policies for energy efficiency building codes for all building sectors (30% reduction) and implementation of energy efficiency in hotels (20% reduction).

Grenada plans to undertake actions including introduction of biofuel blends (specifically liquefied natural gas and diesel blend), implementation of gasoline and diesel taxes and implementation of fuel efficiency standards for vehicles through incentives.

In fact, we are positive,” the Vice President stated.","Our intended contributions are presented below.
Forestry i) Unconditional contributions
Guyana is willing to continue making the following contributions unconditionally:
7
Continue and improve ongoing work to realize sustainable forest management. GFC
will ensure compliance with the various Codes of Practice that govern the timber
industry using local resources.
Forest monitoring will maintain a high level of timber legality, with the GFC
committing 50% of its staff to field monitoring from its 54 forest monitoring stations
countrywide. These efforts will maintain a low rate of illegal logging (at less than 2% of
production).
Guyana is also prepared to finalize and implement the Voluntary Partnership
Agreement (VPA) under EU- FLEGT. The VPA is expected to be finalized in 2016 and to
provide independent accreditation of forest legality and management practices
throughout Guyana‟s timber industry.
We are prepared to improve added- value activities locally to assist in creating a
higher potential for carbon storage in long-use wood products. This could also
potentially reduce the pressure on forest resources as derivation of a higher value
may result in reduced harvest levels.
Indigenous people own and manage some 14% of Guyana‟s lands. The culture and
traditions of Guyana‟s indigenous peoples are rooted in sustainable use of nature,
evident in the forests and other natural ecosystems maintained through centuries on
the lands they have customarily occupied and used. Guyana will strengthen its
support for indigenous communities as they continue the stewardship of their lands
and inter alia the benefits that accrue from any REDD+ activities from these lands.
If they choose to, communities will be supported to better manage their transition to
more market-based means of provisioning for their social and cultural well-being in
ways that continue the tradition of wise use. Indigenous peoples themselves, through
the full application of the FPIC process, in keeping with the stated policy in the
LCDS, will decide whether or not to include their titled lands as part of Guyana‟s
REDD+ programme. Policies will also be implemented to reflect equity between the
extractive sector and indigenous peoples as the nation moves to genuinely ensure
that the fight against climate change continues.
ii) Conditional Contributions
Avoided Deforestation
Guyana‟s proposal for a Reference Level for REDD+ is based on the Combined
Reference Level approach, in which a global forest carbon emissions loss of 0.44%, as
concluded by Baccini et. al. 2012 is used, along with Guyana‟s historic emissions level
for the period 2000 to 2009 (0.06%) as established in the GNA. Using a total carbon
stock of forests in aboveground and belowground biomass of 19,197,411,268 tCO2e,
Guyana‟s Proposed Reference Level for its REDD+ Programme is 48.7 MtCO2e. Through
this approach, Guyana can continue to avoid emissions in the amount of 48.7 MtCO2e
annually if adequate incentives are provided.
8
To contribute to avoided deforestation and achieve an effective REDD+ programme,
Guyana will implement policies measures, and incentive programmes, to engender
broader participation of civil society and the private sector in actions to avoid
deforestation and forest degradation. The Guyana Government is cognizant of the need
for comprehensive land use planning in order to efficiently management and rationally
exploit our national resources.
In summary, avoided emissions contributions resulting from reforms in the timber and
mining industries can contribute up to 48.7 MtCO2e to the global mitigation effort
through the implementation of the Emission Reduction Programme described in greater
detail below.
Emission Reduction Programme for Forests
Given that the bulk of Guyana‟s emissions emanate from mining and logging activities,
our Emissions Reductions Programme (ERP) will therefore focus on making these
industries more efficient and compliant with our targets. With adequate resources,
Guyana will develop a suite of ERP measures that will include:
- the conservation of an additional 2 million hectares through Guyana‟s
National Protected Area System and other effective area -based conservation
measures as per Guyana‟s commitment under the UNCBD, including the
protection of conservancies and reservoirs and their watersheds and the
watersheds upstream of new hydro-power sites. Existing mangrove forests
will be counted in this target and the mangrove restoration programme along
the vulnerable coast will be expanded.
Timber harvesting contributed 40% of Guyana‟s emissions from land use between
2001 and 2012. In the timber industry the ERP will:
• Use of Reduced Impact Logging (RIL). Reducing the incidental and
collateral damage during tree felling by about 10% and the damage from skid
trails by about 35% (avoiding mid-size trees during skidding), could reduce the
annual emissions by 13.5%. This translates to a reduction of about 430,000
tCO2 per year.
This will result in a reduction of the annual emissions from the timber industry
from 3.5M tCO2 to 2.3M tCO2, a 20% reduction from historic levels for this
driver, and an 11% reduction in the overall historic level.
• Guyana is in the process of reviewing compliance of significant timber
concession agreements with a view to determining if they meet agreed targets. 
9
A wider review to determine the most optimal use of these lands will be
undertaken. If, in fact, REDD+ can provide adequate incentives, Guyana would
be prepared to reduce the area to be logged in favour of conservation
concessions and to further the development of non-timber forest products and
other forest-based services while recognizing the need for livelihoods.
Our MRVS has verified that small scale gold mining resulted in 89% of the deforestation
recorded in Guyana over the past three years. To address this, the ERP will include
actions by the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission (GGMC) to implement policy
reforms, education, and incentives for integrated planning and management of the
mining sector. This will support the transformation of the mining sector by 2020 and
include actions to:
• Implement mineral mapping in the mining districts to identify
economically exploitable deposits. This will significantly reduce deforestation
by avoiding clearing of forest cover from lands which contain only marginal
mineral deposits. A significant portion of Guyana‟s deforestation results from
forest clearing for mining that does not generate a profit.
• Implement awareness and incentive programmes to improve the
efficiency of technologies and practices in the mining industry. This will
include replacing inefficient mercury-based technology with more efficient
technologies, such as shaker-tables and centrifuge systems that can increase
gold recovery rates from 30% to 80%. Currently, low recovery rates cause
miners to often return to previously mined areas when technology or
economic circumstances favour them doing so. Improved recovery efficiency
would make reprocessing of sites unnecessary and better facilitate costeffective reforestation and recovery of mined sites.
• Implement policies to institute mandatory, nation-wide land
reclamation and reforestation of mined areas.

Forest Governance
Guyana has made significant progress in complying with EU-FLEGT for our timber
exports to the European Union. Additional resources are required to build institutional
and private sector capacity to meet other trade and supply conditions such as the Lacey
Act, FSC certification and other procurement requirements.
MRVS
A comprehensive and robust MRV system, one of the most advanced of its kind, has
been developed under Guyana‟s REDD+ programme. The development of this system
has contributed considerably to the global understanding of how small forested tropical
countries can reliably and cost-effectively measure and report on its forest carbon 
10
emissions. Guyana is willing to build on the lessons learnt thus far to complete and
maintain its MRVS if adequate financial resources are provided to do so.
Implementation cost
The cost of implementation of these forest-conservation initiatives in total is estimated
to be determined annually.
Energy
Unconditional Contributions
Guyana is in the process of reviewing our options toward the rapid expansion of a
renewable energy supply. Our goal is to develop a mix of wind, solar, biomass and
hydropower to supply both the demand of the national grid and the energy
requirements for towns and villages in Guyana‟s hinterland.
Guyana will seek to construct and/or promote the construction of small hydro systems
at suitable locations such as Moco Moco, Kato and Tumatumari. Guyana will power all
of the six newly established townships, starting with Bartica, using renewable energy
sources. Currently, Guyana has installed cogeneration from bagasse to power sugar
mills. Independent power producers and suppliers are being encouraged to construct
energy farms and sell energy to the national grid. Preliminary approvals have been given
for a 26MW wind farm.
The Government of Guyana will continue to work closely with farmers in agricultural
areas across Guyana to encourage the use of bio-digesters to reduce waste, produce
biogas and provide affordable, healthy and efficient cooking means at the household
level.
Legislation has been enacted to remove import duty and tax barriers for the importation
of renewable energy equipment, compact fluorescent lamps and LED lamps to
incentivize and motivate energy efficient behavior. Guyana will continue to conduct
energy audits and replace inefficient lighting at public, residential and commercial
buildings to reduce energy consumption. Public education and awareness programmes
will continue to play a major role in providing consumers with information and tools to
reduce energy consumption and expenditure. Guyana will implement other policies to
encourage energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, including building codes
and net-metering of residential renewable power.
We expect that these unconditional contributions will significantly reduce Guyana‟s
energy consumption.
Conditional Contributions
Guyana is committed to eliminating our near complete dependence on fossil fuels.
Given our solar, wind and hydropower potential and relatively small national demand, 
11
we believe that with adequate and timely financial support, Guyana can develop a 100%
renewable power supply by 2025. Assessment of the potential of the renewable power
sources will be undertaken to determine the most cost effective and efficient means of
developing this potential; to this end an independent review of the Amaila Falls Project
is to be undertaken with the assistance of the Kingdom of Norway.","Inventory shows negative emissions, and is member of the Climate Ambition Alliance

-30% decrease, respectively, compared with 2005.

While the target for ETS sectors is set at European level, as it is a system applied to all Member States on a harmonised and centralised basis, the target of reducing greenhouse gases relating to sectors falling under the Effort Sharing Regulation is split between the various Member States.

Regulation (EU) 2018/842 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement (the Effort Sharing Regulation, ESR) sets Italy a reduction target of -33% compared with 2005 levels for non-ETS sectors [NECP, p.239]. This target must be achieved by following a linear reduction trajectory that will identify an emissions limit for each year.

""In a phone conversation between EU Ecology Minister Roberto Cingolani, and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, Cingolani said that Italy plans to reduce its carbon emissions by roughly 60% by 2030 from 1990 levels.""

In addition, he has cut the budget of the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources as part of a government austerity program and has criticized environmental NGOs in Mexico for their alleged links with foreign governments.

Biennial update report (https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/tgo.pdf).
Togo's greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 (baseline year) represented just 0.05% of total emissions worldwide. 
Togo commits to limit temperature rise to 2°C by 2030. Togo implemented activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially in the energy, agriculture and LULUCF (land use, land-use change and forestry) sectors. 

In terms of road transport, the planned actions aim to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in Togo by 20% over the course of the period under review, by improving the road system, promoting the use of public transport, reducing the average age of imported vehicles (to 5-7 years) and promoting active modes of transport (bicycles, walking, bike paths).

Equity:
Togo is a small country that emits almost no GHGs and so has virtually no responsibility in terms of global warming. Through its INDC, Togo proposes to focus on carbon-lean sustainable development, by encouraging sustainable practices, whereas the easy solution would simply be to continue using fossil fuels while they are still available.
According to the IPCC, the estimated worldwide GHG emissions for 2010 totalled roughly 40,000 Mt of CO2e. The emissions from the Republic of Togo for the same year were estimated at 20.45 Mt of CO2e, representing about 0.05% of the total volume. The emissions are non-significant compared with worldwide emissions.

The Inflation Reduction Act covers the appropriation of funds and the implementation of charges. 

60 bn dollars are earmarked for funding for ""environmental justice priorities""
Among the funding streams available under the act are $3bn in “environmental and climate justice block grants”, which local governments, Native American tribes and community groups can access to tackle environmental issues in their areas.
Additionally, some funds are appropriated to, among other things, help eligible recipients develop  ""qualified climate action plans"", which include ""a strategy to collaborate with, communicate with, and address potential effects on low-income and disadvantaged near-port communities and other stakeholders that may be affected by implementation of the plan;"" (page 666)

Some funding is appropriated to various federal bodies in order to facilitate ""timely and efficient environmental reviews and authorizations"" However, no schedule is determined.

Democratic senators have quoted the possibility for a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030 (from a 2005 baseline), with the Rhodium group giving similar estimates of 32%-42%, Energy Innovation 37-41%, and 42% according to the REPEAT project based at Princeton University. The climate action tracker estimates a wider potential range of emissions cut
 by 2030 (26 to 42% relative to 2005 levels). bHence, although expected emissions reductions are not included within the actual target plan, this represents a real and tangible impact on future emissions.

It is worth noting, with concern, that the majority of reported financial climate support has not been in the form of grants, but mostly in the form of loans. Be that as it may, South Africa remains committed to doing its best to combat climate change through various measures, drawing on the much appreciated capacity-building, technical and financial support of developed countries.""

Other accountable bodies are the Presidential Climate Change Coordinating Commission (PCCCC) established 17/12/2020:
""The Commission is tasked with advising on South Africa’s climate change response. This includes mitigation and adaptation to climate change and its associated impacts. It will furthermore provide independent monitoring and review of South Africa’s progress in meeting its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. Under the Commission’s Terms of Reference it will advise on and facilitate a common understanding of a just transition, cognisant of the socio-economic, environmental and technological implications of climate change. This covers adaptation, mitigation as well as means of implementation.""

In the updated NDC report- Carbon capture and storage – CO2 compression, hub transport and storage under $20/t of CO2 as well as soil carbon measurements under $3/ha/year
""Carbon capture and storage: The $20 per tonne of CO₂ stretch goal covers CO2 compression, hub transport and storage, but does not cover capture processes, noting the cost of capture technologies varies between applications and depends on factors such as the relative concentration of CO2 for different industrial processes. The stretch goal assumes CO₂ is transported within a hub distance of less than 100 km to suitable reservoirs. Achieving a stretch goal of under $20 per tonne would position CCS to be competitive over the long term with other forms of abatement supported by Australia’s Emissions Reduction Fund. Under a high technology scenario, CCS could be deployed as early as 2025, subject to securing offtake agreements and development approvals.""

soil carbon- ""Soil carbon measurement: The soil carbon measurement stretch goal time range was set based on consultations with industry. Based on a high technology uptake scenario, advancements in proximal sensing, simulation modelling and remote sensing technologies could see the stretch goal of under $3 per hectare per year reached as early as 2025. As of 2020, soil carbon measurement for Emissions Reduction Fund projects were estimated at around $30 per hectare per year (CSIRO estimates based on a land area of 300 hectares; estimates could be lower for larger areas).""

""Achievement of Australia’s priority technology stretch goals will have a significant impact on global emissions. The five technologies first identified in Australia’s first low emissions technology statement (2020) (hydrogen, energy storage, low emissions materials, carbon capture and storage and soil carbon measurement) address emissions in sectors that account for 90 per cent of global emissions, or around 45 billion tonnes CO2-e annually. Australia is targeting international partnerships that support these economic stretch goals, including access to global markets and more competitive supply chains. We are also prioritising partnerships that focus on critical research, development and deployment challenges for economically important, hard-to-abate sectors."" 

so as mentioned above, there is a strong emphasis on technology stretch goals to have an impact on global emissions.









also discusses offsets and sinks in terms of Domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities and indigenous peoples, in a gender-responsive manner; The five yearly review process will allow Australia to take stock of our progress towards our net zero target. This will ensure our policies are calibrated to reflect the latest technology advances, international developments and other factors. It will ensure there is transparency regarding how progress is tracked, including any updates or revisions, achievements and effectiveness of key national policies and investments, as well as the role of state and territory policies and targets in contributing to the national goal.

",,"The primary focus of the NDC is the adaptation component. 
The NDC is conditional; the fulfilment of the NDC is dependent on international financing
The main areas of focus for mitigation emission reduction are:
1. Electricity - 33% reduction 
2. Oil and gas - 65%
3. Transport - 7%
The key for Egypt to mitigate GHGs emissions is to provide appropriate foundations for
the development of low carbon energy systems.
Pathways to achieving high CO2 mitigation levels comprise the following:
 Widespread diffusion of locally-appropriate low-carbon energy production
technologies, with substantial reductions in energy intensity
 Comprehensive mitigation efforts covering all major sources of emissions
 Locally-appropriate technology transfer and financial flows from industrialized
countries (Annex I countries) to support carbon emission abatement according
to the UNFCCC principles, which acknowledges that developed countries should
provide required support to developing countries in this regard.
Policies targeting development that is more sustainable rely upon five main pillars:
1. More efficient use of energy, especially by end users;
2. Increased use of renewable energy as an alternative to non-renewable energy
sources;
3. Use of advanced locally-appropriate and more-efficient fossil fuel technologies,
which is less-emitting, in addition to new generations of nuclear power;
4. Energy efficiency is the cornerstone to be targeted by policy makers to decouple
demand on energy and economic growth; and
5. Reform energy subsidies. This policy is implemented using four pillars, namely:
set different prices for petroleum products based on energy generation
efficiency; increase the efficiency of energy use; provide support to certain
sectors to promote switching from conventional energy sources to clean energy
sources; and apply the fuel subsidy smartcard system to ensure that subsidies
are received by target beneficiaries.
The degree to which efficiency improvements can limit energy demand growth is one
of the main distinguishing characteristics of greenhouse gas reduction pathways.
Energy efficiency could be improved radically through a combination of behavioral
changes and rapid introduction of stringent efficiency regulations, technology
standards, and environmental externality pricing, which mitigates rebound effects.
Renewable energy technologies, which are relevant to the local context, will play a very
important role in reducing GHG emissions, but they would not suffice to keep climate
change manageable. However, renewable energy may provide a number of
opportunities since it also addresses sustainable and equitable economic development,
energy access, secure energy supply, and reduced local environmental and health
impacts. ",https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-07/Egypt%20Updated%20NDC.pdf.pdf,Carbon dioxide and other GHGs,,Not Specified,Yes,Not Specified,,,,No,"Aviation - aim to green the sector by introducing 2% biofuels to airplanes, improve energy efficiency of facilities

The conditions being that Nigeria would need much international support.  It otherwise, has pledged to reduce its GHG emissions by 20%, (using 2018 as baseline year) by 2030. According to the International Energy Association, Nigeria emitted 104.27 MtCO2e in 2018. 2018 MtCO2e levels represents an increase of 271.6% from 1990 levels.  Between 2010 and 2018, Nigeria’s GHG emissions increased by 40% to reach 347 MtCO2eq. The baseline projection has been updated too, estimating GHG emissions at 453 MtCO2eq by 2030, i.e. around half the 2015 estimates and a 31% increase in total GHG emissions between 2018 and 2030 (+2.6%/year).

There was an increase in the net absorptions of CO2 that changed the country's GHG emissions and removals profile, going from a purely emitting country to a sink country from 1994 to 2013.

The results of the 2020 National Inventories Report of greenhouse gases from 1994 to 2017 categorise Panama as a carbon sink country. National emissions are offset by the forest cover in the national territory due to the annual increase in the carbon stocks of secondary forests.

Along with the negative impacts of long-term conflicts, the adverse effects of changing climate are also being faced by the inhabitants of South Sudan. The country is experiencing an increasingly warm and dry climate with erratic rainfall. This is resulting in degradation of ecosystems and decreased agricultural productivity that is negatively impacting the livelihoods of a majority of the population. Political and economic instability, including limited access to capital, markets, infrastructure and technology, along with changing climate, are hindering the growth of the country.
Recognizing this, and to achieve sustainable economic development, South Sudan aims to transition from a least developed country to a middle-income country by 2030, supported by inclusive, stable and sustainable economic growth, while alleviating poverty. Promoting environmental sustainability, climate-resilient communities and appropriate land use has been identified as a critical enabler that will complement the eight strategic priorities of the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2018–2021 (South Sudan Ministry of Finance and Planning 2018)","As part of South Sudan’s increased ambition, this second NDC has also increased the country’s sectoral coverage, and instituted additional mitigation and adaptation measures in sectors that were included in the first NDC.

Public plan: Nevada's 2020 State Climate Strategy has catalog of policies it plans to implement across different sectors, and each policy is assessed on 4 metrics: (1.) GHG Emissions reduction potential; (2.) Climate justice considerations; (3.) Budgetary and economic implications; (4.) Implementation feasibility (Climate Strategy, p.52)

Equity: One of the key metrics per proposed climate policy is climate justice, which is defined as: Have communities of color, low-income households, and tribal partners (i.e., Indigenous communities) been directly engaged and consulted about the challenges and opportunities associated with the policy? Will the policy avoid any negative impacts to vulnerable communities, provide the opportunity for a net benefit, and/or reconcile broader social justice issues?

This law is to be reviewed every 5 years based on indicators such as an evaluation of the state government’s leadership, the number of municipalities with an energy and climate plan, and on the feasibility of objectives. To reduce its reliance on extra-EU imports of vehicles’ batteries, Thuringia recently signed an agreement with the Chinese company CATL (the
world’s largest producer of battery cells for e-cars) for the construction of a new battery cell gigafactory for European-made batteries. ","Greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced by 60 - 70 percent by 2030, by 70 - 80 percent by 2040 and by 80 - 95 percent by 2050. The guiding principle for action is the maximum emission reduction for the country.

By the year 2040, the energy demand in the overall balance in Thuringia should be covered by a mix of renewable energies.

Buildings should ensure a minimum share of renewable energies of 25 percent from 2030 in the case of renovations that require notification and approval. However, if the building owners receive funding for the purpose of climate protection from state funds, the minimum share is 50 percent.

The NT Offset Principles require that offsets maximise the environmental, social and economic co-benefits delivered to the Territory. To achieve this, emissions offsets must be delivered in accordance with the following order of priority:
1. Territory-generated offsets are to be used to deliver as much of the required amount of emissions offsets as possible. This includes ACCUs or alternative offset units generated by abatement projects located entirely or partially in the Territory16. Proponents must ensure (and be able to demonstrate) that all reasonable options to acquire a sufficient amount of Territory-generated offsets have been explored.
2. Where Territory-generated offsets cannot be used to entirely satisfy offset requirements, offsets generated in other parts of Australia or internationally may be used.",,17477364600,,245869,,,,,,,

""Our landscape and natural environment is one of our greatest national assets and has a vital role to play in meeting our ambitious climate change targets. Through significant increases in forestry and widespread peatland restoration in particular, we can reduce greenhouse gases and other pollutants and increase the levels of carbon dioxide being absorbed and locked up in timber products. We will continue to expand forest cover in Scotland, building on the success of creating 22,000 hectares of new woodlands in the last two years. We will increase new woodland creation from the current target level of 12,000 hectares annually in 2020/21 up to 18,000 hectares in 2024/25. Scottish Forestry and Forestry and Land Scotland will work with investors, carbon buyers, landowners and market intermediaries to increase private investment in new woodlands in order to increase the woodland carbon market by at least 50% by 2025. As of March 2020 over 25,000 hectares of peatland have been put on the road to restoration, and earlier this year we announced a £250 million ten-year funding package to support the restoration of 250,000 hectares of degraded peat by 2030. To deliver on the 2032 emissions reduction envelope annual peatland restoration needs to be far higher than the current 20,000 hectare annual target and we will work closely with delivery partners, land owners, managers, farmers and crofters to continue to encourage more restoration of peatland, both traditional bog but also land that offers the highest emission savings per hectare.""

In fiscal year 2018, the Saitama ETS achieved a 29% reduction in emissions below base- year emissions.
In April 2020, the Saitama ETS entered its third compliance period (FY2020-2024), which requires facilities to reduce emissions by 20% or 22% below baseline emissions, depending on their category.
The ‘Zero Carbon Saitama’ initiative was announced in 2018 and includes cooperation with the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee to fully offset the GHG emissions from
the (postponed) Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. As part of this initiative, companies may donate excess credits from the ETS. Companies that do not possess credits but still wish to make donations may purchase credits from larger facilities within the ETS. Credit donations to the program closed in September 2020.",,https://www.pref.saitama.lg.jp/documents/25652/actionplan_2nd_full.pdf,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,,,,,,No,,No,,No reporting mechanism,No,Not Specified,,Not Specified,,,,No,Not Specified,,,,,7338536,,,,,41090000,2018,No

- All 243 local governments nationwide announce the ‘2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration’ for the first time in the world -
Minister of the Interior and Safety Jeon Hae-cheol attends the Green Future Session themed ‘Action of Local Governments towards Carbon Neutrality*’ of the 2021 P4G** Seoul Summit on May 24 (Mon) at the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) in Seoul, Korea. 
* Carbon neutrality: achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by having a balance between emitting carbon and absorbing carbon emissions 
** Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G): a global platform, joined by government agencies, businesses and civil society, that aims to respond to climate change and achieve sustainable development goals as a converged organization in the 21st century 

As the first Breakout Session to be held during the Green Future Week* in the lead up to the 2021 P4G Seoul Summit on May 30-31, the event is designed to discuss the roles and action plan for achieving global carbon neutrality, centering on local governments that are the key players of carbon neutrality.
* Green Future Week (May 24-29): 10 Green Future Sessions on carbon neutrality of local governments, Green New Deal, green technology, forests, etc.  

Representatives of local governments, businesses, civil society and international organizations from around the globe will seek actions of local governments at home and abroad to achieve carbon neutrality and present better alternatives to build back better and greener.

【Key Participants】
▸ Opening Ceremony: Jeon Hae-cheol (Minister of the Interior and Safety), Han Jeoung-ae (Minister of Environment), Ban Ki-moon (President of the Assembly and Chair of the Council of the Global Green Growth Institute), Kate Raworth (Co-founder of Doughnut Economics Action Lab)
▸ Domestic presenters & panelists: Chung Eui-sun (Chairman of Hyundai Motor Group), Kwon Young-jin (Mayor of Daegu & Metropolitan Government Representative of the Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality), Song Ha-jin (Governor of Jeollabuk-do & President of Governors Association of Korea), Won Hee-ryong (Governor of Jeju Island), Hwang Myeong-seon (Mayor of Nonsan & President of National Association of Mayors), etc. 
▸ Overseas presenters & panelists: Secretary General of ICLEI*, Mayor of Bonn, Germany, Mayor of Aarhus, Denmark, Mayor of Medellin, Colombia, Mayor of Kochi, India, Deputy Mayor of Malmö, Sweden, Director of Green Climate Fund, etc. 
* Local Government for Sustainability, ICLEI: a global network of more than 2,500 local and regional governments in 125 countries committed to addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development  
In order to tackle climate change, 226 Korean local governments recognized the state of climate emergency and adopted the Declaration of Climate Emergency in June last year to urge the national government and the National Assembly to declare their commitment to carbon neutrality. 

In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. 

And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. 

With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. 

Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” 

“The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.

"" 
- The first phase (Race to Zero): this phase will include the DIAGNOSIS stage, definition of global GUIDELINES and definition of STRATEGIES to be used in each thematic area to reach the goal of neutralization of the ES global emissions by 2050.
 - The second phase, foreseen for December 2022, extends the detailing of the planning actions, detailing the analysis of the strategies and identifying the barriers for implementation; definition of INDICATORS and GOALS; and an analysis of the limitations, potentials and challenges of each proposed strategy.
 - The third phase, planned for February 2024, includes the PROJECTS necessary to overcome the barriers identified for each of the strategies outlined. In addition, the ACTION PLANS for the execution of the projects will be defined, contemplating the methodology of execution, targets and responsibilities for execution, duly agreed with the parties involved.

Section 30 states that international aviation and shipping are not included. However this has since been updated in the 6th Carbon Budget: ""In line with the recommendation from the independent Climate Change Committee, this sixth Carbon Budget limits the volume of greenhouse gases emitted over a 5-year period from 2033 to 2037, taking the UK more than three-quarters of the way to reaching net zero by 2050. The Carbon Budget will ensure Britain remains on track to end its contribution to climate change while remaining consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goal to limit global warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts towards 1.5°C. For the first time, this Carbon Budget will incorporate the UK’s share of international aviation and shipping emissions – an important part of the government’s decarbonisation efforts that will allow for these emissions to be accounted for consistently."" https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-enshrines-new-target-in-law-to-slash-emissions-by-78-by-2035 

https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/net-zero-target states that ""The Climate Change Act 2008 requires the government to set five-yearly carbon budgets, after taking advice from the CCC. [...]The budgets are fixed in advance and set five-year caps on the total greenhouse gas emissions allowed to ensure the UK meets its emissions reductions commitments."" with the 6th Carbon budget being ""the first to take the net-zero target into account""

The amount of greenhouse gas removal or emissions possible from the UK’s natural environment is dependent on how the UK uses its land and the land’s condition. In 2017, an estimated 28 million tonnes of CO2 and other carbon gases were removed by vegetation in the UK3. Such removals are included and netted off against the UK’s GHG emissions in the Climate Change Act definition of how GHG emissions are measured. However, potential GHG emissions from some areas of the UK’s natural environment that are not in good condition are currently excluded from the definition.

* Renewable energy and cleaner transport set for a boost

By Angelina Davydova

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, Feb 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fossil fuel-rich Russia may not be known as a leader on climate action - but in the country's remote far east, authorities have launched an unexpected experiment: an effort to try out carbon trading and reach net-zero planet-heating emissions by 2025.

The government of the Russian island region of Sakhalin, in the Pacific Ocean north of Japan, is planning tax breaks, charging stations and dedicated parking lots for electric vehicles, alongside a ban on all petrol and diesel cars by 2035.

Coal-fired power plants will be replaced with somewhat cleaner natural gas and hydrogen-fuelled passenger train lines developed in the region the size of Ireland, Sakhalin officials said, after their net-zero roadmap was approved by Moscow.

The Russian government - which has been criticised by green groups and analysts for setting unambitious climate action goals - in January gave a green light to Sakhalin's proposal for a pilot carbon emissions trading scheme, a first for the country.

The economy of the Sakhalin region, home to about half a million people, is largely based on fossil-fuel extraction, including coal.

According to its net-zero plan, an inventory of Sakhalin's greenhouse gas emissions and natural carbon sequestration potential will be carried out by August, before setting up an emissions trading system to start operating in mid-2022.

""This experiment will allow us to try various measures to regulate carbon and evaluate their effectiveness, for later scaling up at the national level,"" Russia's Economic Development Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said in an official statement.

""We hope that investors interested in 'green' projects, and companies willing to take on more ambitious climate targets, will be motivated to participate in the experiment,"" he added.

Sakhalin Deputy Prime Minister Vyacheslav Alenkov told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the region had taken the lead on the initiative, hoping to increase its investment appeal, improve quality of life and help solve environmental problems.

Besides emissions trading and expanding electric mobility, the region also wants to swap coal for lower-emitting natural gas, develop blue and green hydrogen production, and promote sustainable management of its extensive taiga forests.

About 97% of all coal mined there is currently exported, and coal could remain a reserve fuel for Sakhalin, if technologies were introduced to make the industry cleaner, Alenkov said.

ISLAND RENEWABLES?

As well as boosting gas for transport and homes - used now by about one-third of residents - there are plans to develop renewable energy, especially on the Kuril Islands, he added.

As the mountainous Sakhalin region is made up of nearly 90 islands, it is suitable for small-scale hydro, wind and solar power as well as geothermal energy, sources that are still under-developed but could improve energy access, Alenkov said.

An assessment of the opportunities for renewable solutions, including the technologies and funding needed, is due to yield its first results this year and investors are already interested, he added.

Sakhalin also hopes to develop cooperation with other emissions trading systems, including China, Japan and perhaps the European Union, and have its carbon credits approved for the international airline CORSIA offsetting scheme, Alenkov said.

Georgy Safonov, a climate policy researcher at Moscow's Higher School of Economics, said Sakhalin had high potential for bioenergy and renewables, urging the authorities to craft more robust plans for clean energy including green hydrogen, as well as to expand electric transport and forest carbon sinks.

NATIONAL AMBITION LOW

Vladimir Chuprov, head of Greenpeace Russia's energy programme, said Russia was 10 to 15 years behind global trends in regulating carbon emissions.

""It is only now we are getting to what many other countries have already realised,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

But as Russia's national emissions target does not require any real reductions, it will be difficult to build a nationwide carbon market due to a lack of demand for offsets, he added.

A draft of new carbon regulation legislation, which has been worked out over the last four years, does not include a carbon tax or a national emissions trading system, after heavy lobbying from industry, he noted.

Russia joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in September 2019, but its current climate policies and targets are way out of line with the pact's goal to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times, according to research coalition Climate Action Tracker.

Russia's draft long-term low-carbon development strategy, due to be approved this year, is considered by many experts as unambitious, as it does not foresee reaching carbon-neutrality any time before mid-century.

The country's first emissions target under the Paris Agreement, approved by President Vladimir Putin last November, aims for a minimum 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 1990 levels, including the carbon stored in and released from forests and other ecosystems.

But Russia's emissions are already about 30% lower than 1990 levels, without taking forests into account, and just over 50% lower if they are included.

The economy ministry also said in late 2020 the focus for near-term climate policy would be energy efficiency measures, incentives and support for companies to invest in emissions-cutting projects, and an updated methodology to measure forest carbon.

Plans, announced last month, set a new target to increase energy efficiency by 30% from 2019 levels by 2030, after a previous 2020 goal was missed by a long way.

The new target will enable Russia to reduce its carbon emissions by almost half by 2030 from current levels, Deputy Minister of Economic Development Ilya Torosov told journalists.

Alexey Kokorin, director of WWF-Russia's climate and energy programme, said the Sakhalin experiment was possible because oil and gas companies in the region, including Shell, are keen to shrink their carbon footprint and start producing carbon-neutral LNG as part of the Sakhalin-2 project by purchasing offsets.

plan that meets the ambitious objectives of the
Paris Agreement, and with other cities around
the world committed to bold action on climate
change, the City of Dallas has adopted a target
of carbon neutrality by 2050. Carbon neutrality
refers to achieving net zero GHG emissions,
through reducing emissions as much as possible
and then balancing remaining emissions with
carbon removal or carbon offset programs"," In evaluating interim targets for 2030, the
City compared its emissions forecasts against
different target options to understand the scale
of reductions needed from the CECAP actions,
and then selected an interim target that balances
the City’s ambition with the realities of Dallas’
relatively high level of emissions in its base year.
A common approach used by cities is to
set interim targets based on a straight-line
trajectory from their base year to their longterm goal. Figure 16 shows this trajectory
from the 2015 emissions base year to

Karachi comes under one of the fourth provinces of Pakistan; being the capital of Sindh. Sindh government has the 'Sindh Environmental Protection Agency' (SEPA). Therefore it governs the climate goals of Karachi too. Karachi is particularly vulnerable to climate change and therefore climate change adaption is particularly important. The SEPA have outlined their climate goals as:   ''To ensure that climate action is mainstreamed in the development planning, particularly the economically and socially vulnerable sectors of the economy, and to steer Sindh towards economic growth  and climate compatible development .''       

SEPA's policy of climate change  are outlined in their website as ' nuanced province specific policy that is line with National Climate Change Policy (September 2012) and Twelfth Five Year Plan (2018-23) of the federal government that combines inclusive growth with green development. It is unclear how SEPA aligns its policies with the 2021 updated NDC of Pakistan.

Given Orlando’s climate and geographic location, there are tremendous
economic opportunities and benefits for the city to become a leader in solar
energy generation and consumption, as well as to position itself as a hub for
clean technology industries and green jobs. In addition to economic benefits and
job creation, Orlando’s transition to more energy-efficient and clean, renewable
energy resources will also help minimize direct and indirect environmental
impacts, such as the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It will also
help Orlando progress towards its goal of reducing GHG emissions by 90% from
2007 levels by 2040.
In May 2017, Mayor Dyer joined the Sierra Club’s Mayors for 100% Clean Energy
Initiative and expressed his support for transitioning the City of Orlando to
100% clean and renewable energy by 2050 citywide. In addition, Mayor Dyer

In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” “The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.","Anyang City has developed a specific implementation roadmap for greenhouse gas reduction with the goal of ""2050 carbon neutrality"". The city held the final reporting meeting for the ""Anyang Climate Crisis Response Plan"" on the 29th, attended by 30 experts and relevant department heads including Mayor Choi Max Ho, the city announced on the 30th.

The city set ""Anyang, a citizen-led climate crisis leading city"" as its carbon neutrality vision. The five strategies for achieving the goal of reducing greenhouse gases by 40% from the 2018 emission level (2.301 million tons) by 2030 were announced as: Eco-friendly transportation, zero-energy buildings, resource circulation, high-efficiency carbon absorption facilities, citizen participation.

The plan includes a total of 38 projects in the following sectors: Transportation sector with 11 projects (expansion of eco-friendly vehicles, activation of AI-based smart transportation system for public transportation, etc.), building sector with 12 projects (energy efficiency improvement of aged buildings, etc.), waste sector with 9 projects (reduction of waste and activation of recycling, etc.), carbon absorption facilities with 2 projects (creation of public forests to reduce fine dust, etc.), response infrastructure sector with 4 projects (expansion of carbon-neutral environmental education, establishment of climate eco-center, etc.). The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 920 tons by 2030 through these projects.","All South Korean local and provincial governments have joined a 2050 carbon neutrality pledge.

The current number of corridors is smaller than the ideal number of 13 corridors if all villages in Banjarmasin are to be covered. The addition of corridors is constrained by a limited local budget (APBD). In addition to BRT, the Banjarmasin government also provides free bus services of 20 buses, of which 15 are for students and 5 are for disabled groups.

In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” “The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.

In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” “The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.

Interim and long-term targets include a 30% emissions reduction by 2030, 44% by 2040 and net zero by 2050 against the base year emissions of 2019. These targets are based on the pathways scenarios developed as part of the MCAP. These actions would help reduce about 27% emissions in 2030 and 71% emissions in 2050 against the base year emissions of 2019.
Most of the city’s emissions are from energy use in residential buildings, followed by commercial buildings and transport. Electricity consumption contributes significantly to the total emissions (64.3%) due to the predominantly coal-based grid in the city
Based on the baseline assessments, six priorities have been identified for developing mitigation and adaptation strategies for Mumbai to transition to a net zero and climate-resilient city by 2050. They include – Energy & Buildings, Integrated Mobility, Sustainable Waste Management, Urban Greening & Biodiversity, Air Quality, and Urban Flooding & Water Resource Management

In the case of Mumbai, cropland and grassland are extremely small. Settlement
comprises the largest land area, followed by wetland. The two protected areas (PAs) in the city — the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and the Aarey forest — are the forested area.

As part of the Cities4Forests Initiative, the BMC conducted a climate and land use assessment to quantify the role of forests, mangroves and trees in influencing Mumbai’s net GHG flux. Unlike other sectors, forests, mangroves and trees not only emit GHGs, they also remove CO2 from the atmosphere. To develop baseline data for Mumbai, the periods 2010-2016 and 2016-2020 were analyzed for changes in forests, mangroves and Trees outside Forest (ToF). GHG values were estimated for (i) the PAs of Sanjay Gandhi National Park and  Arrey forest, (ii) mangrove forests and (iii) ToF in Mumbai city and Mumbai suburbs separately. (p74)

The City also brought together an informal Equity Stakeholder Working Group to provide feedback and guidance on the development of the CEI. From their feedback, the City recognizes that areas with very low, low, and moderate access to opportunity face the largest barriers and should be prioritized. Staff recommends designating these census tracts as Communities of Concern. 
Working with community-based organizations, the City has defined climate equity as efforts addressing historical inequities suffered by people of color, allowing everyone to fairly share the same benefits and burdens from climate solutions and attain full and equal access to opportunities regardless of one’s background and identity. 
San Diego maintains concentration of clean technology jobs that is twice the national job concentration.

In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” “The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.

In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” “The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.

Direct GHG emissions (scope 1): The reporting of the direct scope 1 emissions is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and covers all direct emissions of greenhouse gases from Ørsted: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulphur hexaflouride. The direct carbon emissions from the thermal heat and power plants are determined on the basis of the fuel quantities used in accordance with the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions outside the EU ETS scheme are, for the most part, calculated as energy consumptions multiplied by emission factors.

Indirect GHG emissions (scope 2): The reporting of the indirect scope 2 emissions is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and includes the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of power, heat, and steam purchased and consumed by Ørsted. The scope 2 emissions are primarily cal- culated as the power volumes purchased multiplied by country-specific emission factors. Location-based is calculated based on average emission factors for each country, whereas market-based takes the green power purchased into account and assumes that the non-green power is delivered as residual power where the green part has been taken out.

Greenhouse gas emissions, scope 3: The scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are reported based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol which divides the scope 3 inventory into 15 subcategories (C1-C15).

In 2016, the company pledged to achieve net zero carbon. "," We’re lucky to have incredible real estate, finance, and facilities teams that aligned with our sustainability goals. Because of these relationships, we were able to reduce carbon intensity by more than one-third in our offices and data centers. Through encouraging a culture of low-carbon commuting for our employees and focusing on why commute choices matter, we were also able to reduce the emissions of the average employee’s commute by more than one-third, too.

'Another successful step along our road to net-zero emissions was working collaboratively with different areas of the business to put an internal price on carbon. Essentially, we allocate carbon costs across each operational function—for example, our data centers or office buildings—which means they are responsible for their emissions. In the long haul, it creates a financial incentive to make better business decisions based on carbon impacts. We then use those carbon-use funds to invest in renewable energy and carbon offsets to help us meet our goals.'

our direct operational emissions and our emissions

by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an
independent global body formed by the United
Nations Global Compact, CDP, the World Resources
Institute and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature.
The SBTi assesses and approves companies’
targets through a scientific lens, ensuring
alignment with the Paris Agreement goal
of limiting climate change to an increase
of 1.5 degrees above pre‑industrial levels.
To achieve this target globally, it is forecast that
net positive carbon emissions will be required.
This is why we have set our 2050 (or earlier)
goal, encompassing scope 1 and 2 emissions,
to go beyond net zero.
Our ambition is to remove more emissions from
the atmosphere than we are responsible for. Our
strategies to achieve this will continue to evolve
over this time horizon and will be communicated
in our sustainability updates and annual reports.
Our main sources of scope 1 (direct) emissions
include emissions from fugitive synthetic
refrigerants, natural gas, transport fuel, stationary
LPG and diesel for onsite back‑up generators,
while our scope 2 (indirect) emissions are those
associated with electricity use. Purchased electricity
represents 82% of our combined scope 1 and 2
emissions, in F21 accounting for 1.91 million tonnes
of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2

most significant category being refrigerant gases.
This year, we emitted over 2.31 million tonnes of

e from facilities across the Group (scope 1 and
2 emissions). Positively, our current emissions are
27% below our 2015 baseline. This continues our
positive trend on emission reductions on both an
absolute basis as well as an intensity measure.
We intend to reduce our scope 3 emissions by
19% from our 2015 baseline. These represent
the emissions in our value chain. Our scope 3
emissions include fuel consumption by our logistics
transport, business travel and home delivery and
trolley collection services. Our value chains are

To achieve this they use ""scalable solutions that are available today"" but also acknowledge ""that achieving net-zero emissions by 2040 will likely require new technologies and mechanisms"". To this end they ""continue to invest in promising solutions"". 

Their climate strategy also has a 'Resilience' strand which focuses on understanding the risks that climate change poses to the business and driving resilience in the face of these events.

by 2030 Microsoft will remove more carbon than it emits, setting us on a path to remove by 2050 all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975. We will achieve this through a portfolio of negative emission technologies (NET) potentially including afforestation and reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs), and direct air capture (DAC).
Microsoft will form its carbon removal portfolio annually by assessing NET attributes pertaining to four criteria: (1) scalability; (2) affordability; (3) commercial availability and (4) verifiability. Given the current state of technology and pricing, we will initially focus on nature-based solutions, with the goal of shifting to technology-based solutions between now and 2050, when they become more viable.

Net Zero 2045  -  Committed to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2045.

In a world racing to reach Net Zero, ENGIE wants to set the pace for decarbonization of the energy industry. In May 2021, ENGIE announced its ambition to become Net Zero by 2045, covering all emissions across its value chain. This long-term ambition is complemented by intermediary targets for 2025 and 2030 and the commitment to maintain a trajectory compatible with well below 2°C.

Emissions related to energy generation and sales represent roughly 85% of ENGIE’s carbon footprint. Achieving Net Zero by 2045 will require a massive switch to decarbonized energy generation and green energy sales.

The procurement of goods and services accounts for 13% of ENGIE’s total footprint remains poorly understood. ENGIE had already set an objective of having all preferred suppliers with Science Based Targets by 2030 compared to 15% today. However, achieving net zero by 2045 will require engaging suppliers on a much greater scale. In a first step, ENGIE’s procurement organization across business entities globally is being upskilled on sector specific supply chain decarbonization opportunities and challenges, and how ENGIE can support suppliers in setting their own decarbonization goals and identifying collaboration projects.",https://www.engie.com/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2023-03/ENGIE_RI23_VA_VDEF.pdf,Carbon dioxide and other GHGs,,,,,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,"Gases: separate target of 30% reduction in methane emissions between 2017 and 2030 worldwide

Although put that the entity has a public plan, this is not as comprehensive a plan as others. There are documents stating targets concerning carbon emissions, but there is a lack of information about how to reach those emissions reductions specifically and lack of numbers around the GHG emissions reductions these would cause. In their net zero plan, they appear to have broken it down into carbon, water, food waste, plastics and recycling, healthy and sustainable diets and biodiversity. These are all important areas for wider sustainability and some will definitely contribute to emissions reductions, but they lack a clear link to emissions reductions with the only real reference to how these are linked to climate action is the UN's Sustainable Development Goal icon for climate action. Some do have concrete goals i.e. ""increasing the percentage of its fleet using alternative zero and low carbon fuels to 20% by 2025"". However on the whole, the plan lacks a cohesive concrete assessment of the whole emissions scope of the entity.

Carbon offsets are an important tool that enables companies to invest in projects that reduce GHG emissions and, in many cases,
create valuable social and community co-benefits. At JPMorgan Chase, we purchase offset credits to address emissions that we are
unable to abate through efficiency improvements or other measures. We purchase offset credits that have been certified by accredited
third parties, which means they are real, additional and independently verified. We also strive to source offset credits that are
generated from projects located in areas where JPMorgan Chase has a presence, and that have additional co-benefits.

The organisational lack of clarity, as well as convoluted figures on current emissions across different scopes makes this target hard to evaluate.  New Climate report states that DHL has pledged to reduce all logistics-related emissions to net zero by 2050, but no further long-term emissions reduction target is stated.

Total emissions from 2020 seems to range from 27-39 MTCO2e across reports from the company, where scope 3 is measured inconsistently: Deutsche Post DHL changed from a tank-to-wheel to a well-to-wheel calculation approach to estimate its GHG emissions in March 2021. According to the company, this approach led to an increase of its total emissions in 2020 from 27.38 to 33.3 MtCO2e, of which 8.0 MtCO2e are scope 1, 0.2 MtCO2e scope 2 (market-based) and 25.0 MtCO2e scope 3 emissions. A further breakdown of emissions is not yet available. The new estimates reported by Deutsche Post are lower than the sum of 39.10 MtCO2e in the company’s ESG Statbook, so it remains unclear whether all emission sources are included.

Information on contentious nature of offsetting projects involving Deutsche Post DHL:
Deutsche Post has looked for some of the higher quality credits available on the voluntary carbon markets. The company has five minimum criteria for credits, related to third-party monitoring and verification; transparency and the avoidance of double counting; permanence; sustainable development; and leakage. In addition, the company aims to prioritise projects that centre around renewable energy, waste disposal and household appliances; are small and with co-benefits for local communities; and located in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Finally, Deutsche Post states that it prioritises credits with more recent vintage dates over older ones and avoids credits older than five years.150Based on these criteria, Deutsche Post sourced offset credits from seven projects in 2020. Those include wind power projects in Aruba and in India, cookstove projects in Guatemala and Lesotho, a landfill gas project in Chile, and a biogas programme in Vietnam.151 The cookstove project in Lesotho was solely funded by Deutsche Post DHL and all projects are Gold Standard verified.152 All of these project types represent some of the higher quality ones available in recent years. Unlike the majority of projects that supply current voluntary carbon markets, there is a fair chance that these seven projects depend on revenue for continuation and that the support provided by Deutsche Post leads to some additional climate impact. However, in the context global governance framework of the Paris Agreement, which requires all countries to set ambitious emission reduction targets, the additionality of these types of projects is contentious, as they may be accessible to host countries and could be part of host countries’ own GHG emission abatement efforts. As such, the projects are not a credible equivalent to the reduction of Deutsche Post DHL’s own emissions. The same is true for the eight projects that Deutsche Post DHL selected in early 2022. https://newclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CorporateClimateResponsibilityMonitor2022.pdf",,,76200000000,,Transportation services,,499461,,,,

We follow the mitigation hierarchy and actively work to avoid and reduce emissions before considering offsets. We will only use offsets to abate residual emissions where economically viable decarbonisation opportunities and technologies are unavailable at the scale or within the timeframes required.
Fortescue was founded on the belief that communities should benefit from our success. We give preference to offsets that provide biodiversity, social and economic benefits to the communities where we operate.
During FY22, we expanded our due diligence criteria beyond environmental integrity to only procure offsets from projects that align with our Human Rights Policy. We will adhere to rigorous offset selection criteria to ensure only offsets that meet a high standard are sourced. (Pg. 15)

Offsets
During FY22, we acquitted offsets to reduce our net emissions by 0.26 million tonnes of CO2-e. These included Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) from a range of Human Induced Regeneration projects and Verified Carbon Units from the Caribbean Guatemala Conservation Coast project and wind power projects.
Some of the ACCUs surrendered were from the Curraweena Regeneration Project in New South Wales. This project established permanent native forests on land that had previously been cleared and regrowth suppressed for at least 10 years.
Regeneration was encouraged by altering traditional farming land management practices. The project is located next to

WesCEF recognises it has a role to play in addressing climate change and reducing its carbon footprint for current and future generations. WesCEF has always been an early adopter of emissions reduction technology. The installation of catalysts in its nitric acid plants from 2011 has resulted in a significant reduction in emissions. In the 2021 financial year, 742,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions were avoided using this technology. As the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the Wesfarmers Group, WesCEF currently emits approximately 880,000 tonnes a year of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, primarily from its Chemicals businesses. Reducing WesCEF's Carbon Footprint WesCEF aspires to net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050, which it aims to achieve through investment in research, technology, energy and transport efficiency, and process optimisation. To ensure climate change is coordinated and managed across WesCEF, a Climate Change Policy was introduced this year, along with the formation of a dedicated Climate Opportunities team to lead the organisation’s development of a roadmap to achieve WesCEF’s emissions reduction target. Wide consultation with key internal and external stakeholders will inform the roadmap and when complete, the roadmap will guide WesCEF’s focus on abatement efforts. At present, no known cost-effective technologies exist for WesCEF to attain net zero emissions while maintaining Wesfarmers’ objective of providing a satisfactory return to shareholders. However, WesCEF also recognises there is considerable investment and innovation with respect to climate change and it expects rapid technology development in the coming years. As a result, the roadmap will be a living document that will evolve as technology develops. A range of climate change initiatives are also either underway or being investigated, including: becoming a founding member of the Australian Energy Transition Initiative, which involves other industrial giants as well as banks, superannuation companies and not-for-profit organisations, aiming to develop pathways and actions that can accelerate emissions reductions across whole supply chains sponsoring CSIRO research into carbon capture and utilisation options continuing to improve the abatement catalysts in our nitric acid plants which convert greenhouse gases into passive, inactive gases that are safe for the environment, to limit nitrous oxide emissions. To further understand its complete carbon footprint, WesCEF is expanding its reporting around Scope 3 emissions.

Update on climate change targets
In 2020, Thomson Reuters joined the Science Based Targets initiative, committing to reduce Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2030 from 2018 baseline levels, as well as reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel and energy-related activities, business travel, and employee commuting by 25% by 2025 from 2019 baseline levels. Additionally, Thomson Reuters aims to require 65% of suppliers by spend to have Science Based Targets by 2025.
This year, we report an update on those goals. Largely through investment in renewable power for our facilities, we’ve been able to drive more than a 93% reduction in GHG emissions from our 2018 baseline. To date, business travel emissions are 91% lower than our 2019 baseline, and we have made progress on our engagement target with our supply chain, with 27% of suppliers by spend committed to Science Based Targets. In addition to the switch to renewable energy, Thomson Reuters is carbon neutral through offsetting the remaining portion of its GHG footprint through carbon offsets, and we continue to refine our procurement process to incentivize working with suppliers who share our commitment to sustainability.

used to try and measure the alignment of a portfolio or an
asset class with the Paris agreement, i.e to limit global warming
to below 2°C by 2100 compared to preindustrial levels. The
data lacks robustness and is still being adjusted with models
and methodologies that are improving regularly. Rather than
the absolute level of portfolio temperature, SCOR prefers to
consider the trend. As in the past, SCOR has selected
Carbon 4(1) for this assessment. According to the 2020 model
changes implemented by Carbon 4(2), the measurement is
stable year on year at 2.8°C (would have been stable at 3.1°C
before changes in methodologies). ","As a member of the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance,
SCOR has committed to setting targets for the decarbonization
of its portfolio. The baseline is end of year 2019 and the target
is set over a five year time horizon, running until the end of 2024.
SCOR believes that the carbon footprint is more meaningful
when taking scope 3 (other indirect emissions(3)) into account
and that carbon intensive sectors are the ones for which scope 3
matters most. For these reasons and despite some weaknesses in
the current data, SCOR has decided to set Carbon Intensity
targets including scope 3 for its corporate bond and equities
sub-portfolio based on the Enterprise Value of issuers.
SCOR commits to reducing its carbon intensity by 27% by
end of 2024 for corporate bonds and equities sub-portfolios.
This will be achieved by combining a best- in- class selection
with active engagement with investees, in order to impact the real
economy. The decarbonization path cannot be achieved by rebalancing the highest emitting sectors to the least emitting ones;
with no consideration in terms of supporting companies with
credible paths to decarbonization. Progress should be measured
globally over the period, bearing in mind the lag of data and the
time it takes for companies to show visible results in their own
decarbonization path.

eight per cent on FY2021, and 10 per cent lower
than our FY2017 baseline.
Our total Scope 3 emissions reported
under our SBTi-approved emissions reduction
target increased by four per cent in FY2021 to
22,347 kt CO2-e, and were 19 per cent lower
than our FY2017 baseline, largely reflecting lower
output from our owned and contracted generation
resulting in an increase in net electricity purchases
from the NEM and external sources, partly offset
by a reduction in domestic gas sales at Australia
Pacific LNG primarily due to the roll off of legacy
contracts. Further details are provided in the
following section.

The world is rapidly accelerating towards a
lower-emissions future, and we will play an
important role in that transition. We will help

to meet decarbonisation goals, not just for the
energy sector, but also for other sectors across
the economy.

emissions target to 2022
Net zero emissions refers to achieving
an overall balance between greenhouse
gases emitted in operation and
greenhouse gases removed from the
atmosphere. Getting Dexus to net
zero is an opportunity to align with
changing customer sentiment and
meet the increasing investor demands
for low-carbon investments.
We have made great progress on our
goal already and have brought forward
our target to achieve net zero emissions
to 30 June 2022, advancing our original
2030 goal by eight years. Accelerating
our net zero ambition delivers strong
climate action for our planet, enhances
our vision and customer proposition
for smart, sustainable workspaces
and ensures we will be ready for other
opportunities, including supporting our
customers on their own journey.
Our commitment to deliver net zero
emissions by 30 June 2022 will be
achieved by:
1. Our transition to 100% renewable
electricity from base building
operations from July 2021, purchasing
renewable energy in the form of
Large-scale Generation Certificates
or GreenPower
2. Continuing to invest in certified
carbon offsets for our remaining
emissions. We will purchase
accredited nature-based offsets to
account for emissions from natural
gas, wastewater, refrigerants, and
waste/recycling
3. Verifying we are net zero and
maintaining this status through
Australia’s Climate Active carbon
neutral program
In parallel with this transition, our focus
remains on improving energy efficiency
and accelerating the deployment of
on-site renewables (see pages 56-57).
Transitioning to 100% renewable
electricity will account for around
80% of scope 2 and 3 emissions, with
the remaining 20% of scope 1 and 3
emissions to be balanced through
carbon offsets.
This includes emissions for the base
building sources comprising electricity,
natural gas, diesel, refrigerant leakage,
water and wastewater, and waste and
recycling. It excludes tenant sources
such as tenancy electricity.

Our approach on this journey involves:
– Reducing or eliminating emissions at
source through efficiency practices and
emission-free energy
– Investing locally, prioritising Australianbased projects with a geographic
correlation to the location of our
properties to support those local
communities
– Being transparent and verifiable, by
investing in certified renewable energy
and offset schemes, and certifying
and disclosing our outcomes with
independent verification
– Making a difference in Australia’s
transition, by supporting supply chains
and the development of renewable
energy and abatement projects
In line with the Oxford Offsetting Principles,

(Pg. 69) 2030 Goal: Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions
Description. Drive a 10% reduction in our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from 2020 to 2030.
Baseline. Progress measured as percent reduction from our calendar year 2019 emissions. Our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in 2019 were 2.88 million metric tons of CO2e.
Progress in 2021. During 2021, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased by approximately 14% from the 2019 baseline.
Looking Ahead. In 2022, we will continue to take action to reduce emissions through abatement, investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation.
In addition to this 2030 goal, in April 2022 we announced a new commitment to reach net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Next year we will begin reporting progress toward both the 2030 and 2040 commitments. ",,"Building on its 2030 commitments, Intel has announced its target for net zero (scope 1 and 2) by 2040.

A more streamlined framework allows us to better assess risk within our portfolio as a result of changing regulation and market demand during a shift to a low carbon economy. Following the conclusion of this work, we made two major changes 1) combining our environmental policy with our relationship review oversight policy and 2) designed a climate risk working group. These changes better streamlined environmental risk into our well defined relationship risk process, allowing an integrated approach to management, and the climate risk working group will streamline communications around climate risk to address risks and opportunities at an enterprise level instead of one off. Increasing temperatures caused by climate change have the potential to significantly increase the cost to power U.S. Bank’s over 3,000 locations. We need to manage physical climate change risks and opportunities through rigorous energy efficiency programs and have done this through building upgrades.

NATURE BASED: 

We also support Arizona’s Climate Change Action Plan through our participation in an afforestation program called Trees for Tucson in Tucson, Arizona. Since 2017, we have contributed to planting approximately 2,258 trees in the Tucson metropolitan area. These trees sequester CO2, helping to offset CO2 in the atmosphere.

CREDITS AND OFFSETS: 

Purchased credits in 2020 = 113 thousand metric tonnes of CO2 and in 2021 = 86 thousand metric tonnes CO2e. 
Natural pipeline business segment, which owns a 50% interest in and operates Ruby Pipeline L.L.C has been net zero since 2011 by using emission reduction credits or renewable energy credits to offset Scope 1 and 2 emissions from construction and ongoing operations. In 2021, Ruby purchased approximately 86 thousand credits. These credits are verified through a third party but no clear carbon credit conditions specified.

• S1&2: -50% by 2030 from 2019 
• S3: -29% by 2030 from 2019","Carrefour has pledged to increase its reduction target from 55% by 2040 to carbon neutral by this date. It has more specific targets for scope 1 & 2 emissions, yet the value of this is severely limited by the fact that only 2% of total emissions are S1 &2. S3 targets are more promising, with a pledge to reduce emissions by 29% in 2030 compared to 2019 levels, as well as planning to use only renewable energy by 2030. It is unclear whether reported emissions and targets may exclude emissions from administrative buildings, warehouses, and operations outside of the nine countries that Carrefour refers to as its integrated countries, since these emissions are excluded from the company’s GHG reporting in its annual report.

2011 as a baseline, exceeding the 5% reduction target
we had established (Pg.36).

In 2018, two of its group companies mention their own emission reduction target (Pg. 86):
""Great-West Lifeco has a strong commitment to minimizing its environmental impact, to reporting highquality emissions data and reducing emissions across its operations. In 2017, the company strengthened
this commitment by establishing long-term GHG emission reduction targets for its Canadian properties,
specifically 27 per cent by 2025 and 50 per cent by 2036. Throughout the year, its property and asset
management teams worked collaboratively toward these goals, implementing realistic and economically
feasible projects to reduce the company’s carbon footprint, such as building equipment retrofits, data centre optimizations
and operational enhancements. Between 2013 and 2017, the company achieved a 17.7 per cent reduction in GHG emissions
in its managed real estate portfolio.""

""IGM Financial is also committed to transparency and accountability on climate issues. As such, in 2017, IGM Financial
obtained a score of A- (Leadership) as part of the 2017 CDP survey, ranking in the top five financial services companies in
Canada for the fourth year in a row. IGM Financial has set short- and long-term GHG emission reduction targets using 2013
as a base year. The objective is to achieve a 40 per cent reduction in absolute GHG emissions from energy use at owned
assets by 2020 (Scope 1 and 2) and to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in absolute GHG emissions from energy use at
owned assets by 2036 (Scope 1 and 2). Thanks to its various energy efficiency projects underway and its strategy of
purchasing renewable energy for its owned office building, the company’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions have decreased
substantially, representing a 66 per cent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from 2013 to 2017.""

The company has the same target from 2015 till 2021, despite 2020 being the target year.

Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets...
... Since the TEPCO Group transferred its fuel and thermal power business to JERA in April 2019, our Scope 1 emissions are now extremely low at 203,000 tons. However, greenhouse gas emissions during the retail sale of power, which account for the majority of Scope 3 emissions, must be estimated and reported in accordance with the Law Concerning the Promotion of the Measures to Cope with Global Warming. Therefore, the TEPCO Group has set a target of reducing CO2 emissions originating from the sale of power by 50% (of 
FY2013 levels) by the year FY2030. CO2 emissions in FY2013 were 139.2 million tons. By promoting the use of renewable energies and procured electricity from highly efficient thermal power stations, in FY2020 we were able to reduce this amount to 83.6 million tons (quick estimate), which corresponds to approximately 80% of our target. We will continue to further promote the use of renewable energies and recommence operation of nuclear power stations in order to achieve our target.

• assess our carbon footprint across our whole supply chain, from packaging and raw material procurement, to consumer-generated waste. this helps us understand and anticipate our impact on the environment and on climate.
• commit to ambitious science-based targets to align with the goals of the paris agreement and track our progress in reducing emissions.

In addition, the company does not report on deforestation emissions resulting from its operations. JBS’s entire emissions footprint is estimated at 280MtCO2e; yet the company reports less than 3% of this.","S1&2: -30% by 2030, from 2019. Unclear if absolute or intensity target.","JBS' overall net zero target is clearly outlined, however current publications of emissions neglect an extreme amount of wider scope emissions from livestock practices which are within the supply chain, but not directly JBS owned. This reduces confidence in the net zero claim, depending on the baseline emissions from which net zero will be achieved. The Interim targets are uncertain, but aim for a 30% reduction in either intensity, or absolute emissions by 2030 from 2019 levels. JBS is projecting future growth into a very carbon-intense market, which is coupled by very little detail beyond the headline claims.

",Not Specified,,,,Yes,Not Specified," In its communication on its net zero target, JBS says that it wants to reduce direct and indirect GHG emissions, while offsetting residual emissions. The company does not have a reduction target accompanying its net-zero headline pledge. It is therefore unclear what share of JBS’s emissions footprint will be offset by 2040. Given the limited detail on emission reduction measures and the expected continuous growth  the company, this share could be significant. JBS does not specify any details regarding what kind of offsetting projects it will procure credits from, the potential volume of credits it envisages needing, nor general criteria for ensuring robust environmental integrity in any offsetting claims it may make.

Overall, claims made for offsetting, as well as drive for 100% renewables by 2040, however there is very little detail on how this will become tangible, as well as continued uncertainty about the actual magnitude of emissions which JBS considers its own and therefore is pledging to offset.

50% compared to 2019 levels by 2030, and then, to reach Net Zero by 2040. Secondly, we set two targets regard- ing Scopes 1 and 2 emissions–CO2 emissions resulting from our Group-wide production activities. We will reduce Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 50% compared to 2014 levels by 2030 and then achieve Net Zero by 2040. We have already succeeded in reducing our Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by more than 40%. Today, we are proceeding with plans to demonstrate our Carbon Neutral Factory concept at Mihara Machinery Works in western Japan. We aim to achieve Carbon Neutrality at this manufacturing facility mainly by replacing conventional power sources with green energy derived from renewables, electrifying heat sources, and installing energy management systems. By applying the e?perience gained through these e?orts and working closely with our peers in industry, we will develop innovative, carbon neutral solutions and propose them to our customers.

This offsetting was carried out both nationally and internationally, not only with the idea of collaborating with Sustainable Development Goal 13 “Action for Climate” but also with other SDGs, such as Goal 12 “Responsible consumption and production” and Goal 15 “Life in earth ecosystems”.
The national projects are located in the provinces of Burgos and Palencia, and they are certified by the Spanish Climate Change Office of the Ministry for the Energy Transition and the Demographic Challenge. Both projects aim mainly to recover the vegetation cover and maintain it, avoiding desertification, while increasing the biodiversity of the area and maximising CO2. capture. Various native species have been planted, such as Quercus pirenaica, Quercus ilex, and Pinus nigra hispanica, shaping the future tree mass.

CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE: CBRE) today announced its commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. This commitment encompasses carbon emissions from CBRE’s own operations and the properties it manages for investors and occupiers, as well as indirect supply chain emissions.

“As the world’s largest manager of commercial real estate, we have a special obligation to help the world address the many challenges posed by the warming planet,” said Bob Sulentic, CBRE’s president and chief executive officer. “CBRE is deeply committed to doing our part and to working with our clients and across our vast global supply chain to help achieve net zero emissions as quickly as possible. This is an essential element of our commitment to the communities in which we operate.”

As a part of its 2040 net-zero emissions strategy, CBRE today signed The Climate Pledge, a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon 10 years ahead of the goal stated in the Paris Agreement. The Climate Pledge, co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism, forms a cross-sector community of companies and organizations committed to net zero carbon by 2040, working together to take action to address the climate crisis and solve the challenges of decarbonizing our economy.
The net zero commitment builds on the company’s science-based emissions reduction target announced last year.

Scope 3 with a target of  79% for Occupiers and 67% for investors.  This target covers GHG emissions from the company’s global operations and is aligned with the ambition of the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. In order to achieve this target, we have committed to achieving 100% renewable electricity by 2025 and to transitioning our fleet to electric vehicles.

“We unite Turkey and the world for a sustainable life with leading enterprises”

Mr. Alper said: “Last year we revised our Group’s common purpose as: ‘We unite Turkey and the world for a sustainable life with leading enterprises.’ We have also prepared a 5-year strategic plan based on the findings of a comprehensive study we conducted across our entire Group to foresee the post-pandemic world. This plan includes 5 strategic directions that we believe will lead us to our Group’s goal: Provide wider customer experience, transform into an agile global/local footprint, pioneer in sustainability, lead in digital & material technologies and adapt to future of work. In addition, as the Group, we announced our long-term sustainability goals by committing to reach 'Net Zero Emissions’ by 2050.”

“We have drawn different roadmaps for all our group activities”

Sabancı Holding CEO Cenk Alper said that some solutions needed for net zero emissions and zero waste are not yet technologically possible: “We have drawn a long roadmap, we want to implement it. Within the group, we analyzed all our group activities and drew different roadmaps for each and single entity. Some of these goals and activities towards zero carbon emissions are clear now, but if the necessary solution is not available in the world, we will join the worldwide networks to find the necessary solutions. We plan to achieve half of our goals by 2030. We talk about this at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.

Based on a comprehensive partnership agreement entered into between Hisayama Town, Fukuoka Prefecture,  Kyushu Electric Power, and Kyushu University Urban Institute, we are piloting this project in a town-owned  forest in Hisayama Town to confirm its feasibility and effectiveness.

determining our total carbon
footprint. In addition to Scope 1 and
Scope 2, in 2020 we implemented
specific carbon footprint analysis
on four of our key car models and
in relation to our 2019 Formula 1
activities. These studies allow us
to focus on elements to reduce
our carbon footprint. For example,
through innovations in our vehicles,
we continue to target reductions
in CO2 emissions of our fleet. At
production site level, our purpose
is to minimize our environmental
impact by implementing energy
efficiency activities and by
continuing to purchase Guarantee
of Origin certificates in order to
increase the percentage of energy
consumed by Ferrari derived from
renewable sources, thus reducing
the corresponding CO2 emissions.
In this Sustainability Report
we disclose our impacts and
performance according to the
requirements of the GRI Standards.
Moreover, we report two indicators
to monitor our economic growth
and its climate impact: the Carbon
on net revenues ratio and the
Carbon on Adj. EBITDA ratio. These
two indicators show that Ferrari
managed to decouple its economic
growth from its environmental
impact. In other words, we keep on
growing our business activities while
at the same time maintaining almost
stable our CO2 emissions.",No,,Annual reporting,No,No,,Not Specified,,,,No,Not Specified,,,,4200000000,,Manufacturing,Transportation equipment,4285,,,,

Upstream, the carbon footprint of purchased raw materials is the most significant category. Arkema is engaged in a pro-climate dialog with its suppliers, and encourages them to define before 2025 SBT targets for their scopes 1 and 2.
Downstream, a reduction in activities in the most emissive fluorogas applications targeted by the Kyoto Protocol and the development of new generation fluorogases (HFOs) for high value added activities are major drivers for reducing scope 3.
The Group also leverages the strength of its innovation for sustainable development, and in particular its “Lightweight materials and design” innovation platform, to shift its product and service offering towards solutions that contribute to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

target will mainly be achieved by purchasing metal with a
low-carbon footprint, and reflects our growth ambitions in

Hydro is pursuing three decarbonization pathways to further
reduce the carbon footprint of aluminium. To secure the value
of existing smelters, Hydro is developing carbon capture and
storage (CCS) solutions that can be retrofitted into existing
aluminium plants. Hydro is collaborating with the technology
provider Verdox. The first technology test was successfully
completed in 2022, and a second test is planned to start in
early 2023.

Another pathway more suited for greenfield smelters is
Hydro’s proprietary HalZero technology. This is technology
based on converting alumina to aluminium chloride prior to
electrolysis in a process where chlorine and carbon are kept
in closed loops, resulting in a fully decarbonized process.
Hydro aims to deliver the first zero-carbon primary aluminium
from the HalZero industrial pilot plant by 2026.
Recycling post-consumer aluminium, is a third and faster
pathway to zero-carbon aluminium. Using 100 percent postconsumer scrap, Hydro will be able to produce near-zero
carbon products at a competitive abatement cost. In 2022,
Hydro produced its first near-zero aluminium based on 100
percent recycled post-consumer scrap.

Newcrest sets goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050
Newcrest’s Purpose is “To create a brighter future for people through safe and responsible mining”.
This Purpose underpins our commitment to take on the challenge of climate change and to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions.
Our goal is net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Newcrest is taking action to manage climate change risks and opportunities.
In June 2019, we released our Climate Change Policy which outlined our commitment to the sustainable discovery,
development and production of gold and copper, together with our plans to identify, assess and report our responses to climate
change challenges.
This Policy continues to direct our actions to build a sustainable, resilient business which will thrive in a low carbon future,
encompassing:
• a better understanding of the life-cycle GHG emissions for the gold and copper value chains
• increasing the transparency of our climate change reporting of performance metrics and targets
• reporting our energy use, Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and our performance against targets annually
• working with our suppliers and customers to better understand our Scope 3 emissions
• ensuring that our measuring, reporting and verification processes are robust across all operating sites
• assessing options to increase our use of renewable power and low emission energy technologies
• focusing on opportunities to improve our energy efficiency to reduce energy used and reduce direct mining costs
• identifying and pursuing best practices in the mining and metals industry and partner with technology developers
• assessing climate change scenarios and the projected future price of energy in our medium to long term portfolio
analysis
• partnering with experts and research organisations to identify potential physical threats from climate change at our
current and planned operating sites and invest in appropriate adaptation responses to build resilience
• contributing constructively to policy development in our host countries.
In June 2019 we also set a target to reduce our GHG emissions intensity by 30% by 2030 against our FY18 baseline.
We are making progress.
• We have developed GHG Management Plans for each operating site to understand the abatement opportunities.
• We have directly linked achievement of the actions detailed in these plans to senior executive incentive payments.
• We are progressively improving the measurement of our GHG emissions across our full value chain.
• We are increasing our use of renewable sources of energy. For example, we have entered an agreement to purchase
40% of the energy requirements of our Cadia operation from a wind farm which is expected to be generating from
2024.
• We are well advanced in assessing the risks and opportunities for our business under selected climate change
scenarios in line with the Paris Agreement goals.
Newcrest now wishes to set a new longer-term goal, which is to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This goal will apply
to our operational (Scope 1 and Scope 2) emissions.
We will also continue working across our value chain to reduce Scope 3 emissions.
We will continue to be guided by our Climate Change Policy as we pursue this.
Our energy and emissions performance is reported in our Sustainability Reports and we support the Taskforce on Climaterelated Financial Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations for reporting climate change risks and opportunities.","Climate change update

This audit gives us data to help drive meaningful reductions in our internal emissions and informs our goal to reach Net Zero Carbon for Operations by 2030, including our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. In addition, we launched our Bitcoin Clean Energy Investment Initiative to help accelerate renewable energy adoption in bitcoin mining.  Our Scope 3 footprint is 98% of our total carbon footprint and tracks everything from emission calculations attributed to our credit card processing to energy consumption by Square sellers using our hardware. 
“Committing to be a net zero carbon contributor is consistent with our purpose of economic empowerment, as we’ll continue to work for our customers without contributing to longer-term climate issues,” said Square Chief Financial Officer, Amrita Ahuja. “Endangering the environment will ultimately disproportionately endanger underserved communities around the world.”

To push boundaries, we decided to extend Scope 3 with the energy use from our products: the transactions our merchants’ shoppers carry out on POS terminals, online and mobile payments. 

When gathering these results, we decided to include an estimation of increased CO2 emissions coming from our employees’ homes in 2020 and added that to our Scope 3 emissions.

In addition to the positive environmental impact these projects have, we opted for projects touching upon a wide spread of the United Nations’ SDGs – underscoring that we care about all of these. All projects invested in were carefully selected based on the synergies they create between generating renewable energy, reforestation, wildlife protection and advancing socio-economic wellbeing for local communities. This, we believe, fosters true sustainability.

In 2019, we compensated for all greenhouse gases emitted in our operations since our foundation in 2006. We did this by purchasing credits from third-party verified emissions reduction projects - also known as “carbon offsets”.

Compared to the base year 2019, this equals a total reduction of ~70%. To reach this goal, we plan to spend on average ~1% of revenue per year.",,https://www.sartorius.com/en/company/sustainability/environment,https://www.sartorius.com/download/1273398/sag-gri-report-en-2021-pdf-data.pdf,Not Specified,,,,,Yes,Yes,Partial,No,"For Scopes 1 and 2, Sartorius aims to achieve an average annual reduction in CO2 emission intensity of approx.
20% in the period until 2030. This equates to the elimination of some 90% of the emission sources in Scopes
1 and 2 and – despite significant corporate growth – a 50% reduction in associated absolute emissions com-
pared to 2019.

The analysis of Scope 3 emissions is complex and necessitates consideration of numerous interdependencies
within the supply chain and requires assumptions to be made. Some 40% of emissions attributable to Sartorius
occur in the upstream value chain, i.e. in connection with purchased goods/services and business travel. Some
of the ways in which Sartorius is able to influence these emissions include the nature and volume of purchased
materials and products, the choice of transport routes and modes of transport, and the number of business
trips and their respective itineraries. Emissions can be reduced in the medium term through the selection of
suppliers. Sartorius works to support suppliers in the development and implementation of sustainability sys-
tems that reduce the CO2-equivalent emissions intensity in the upstream value chain.
The largest share of emissions attributable to Sartorius – roughly 50% – occurs in the downstream value chain;
this includes, among other things, the transportation of our products to customers as part of the products’
further use and their disposal at the end of their life cycles. Sartorius can help to lower these emissions, chiefly
by means of optimized product and packaging design that improves the products’ energy efficiency or facili-
tates their recycling. However, a large proportion of the emissions in Scope 3 can only be reduced by our cus-
tomers and transport contractors or in partnership with these actors and/or through a switch to energy from
emission-free sources throughout the entire value chain.
Overall, Sartorius aims to reduce Scope 3 emission intensity by about 10% on average per annum in the period
until 2030. ",No,,Annual reporting,No,Yes,"Reporting: The new CO2 intensity reduction targets will be used in our planning from Q1 2022. Accordingly, we plan to report the corresponding reductions from the next annual report.

our commitment to significant ongoing improvement to environmental performance. Over the course of 2020, Marathon Oil built out processes to monitor progress on this goal. We believe that focusing on our overall GHG intensity provides us the flexibility to use multiple solutions for the largest impact rather than focusing at a constituent level, which may have limited solutions and less overall impact.

The board has ultimate responsibility for risk management, and their decision-making takes climate-related risks into account. In 2019,
we added climate change risk oversight to the charter of the Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility (HES&CR) committee of the board of directors to highlight how seriously we approach robust understanding and evaluation of climate risk. This committee meets at least twice per year to understand and monitor climate-related trends, issues, legislation, policies, practices and concerns.
Our executive vice president of Operations, who reports directly to the CEO, has leadership responsibility for climate-related issues. He provides regular updates to the board regarding performance.
Our vice president of Health, Environment, Safety, Security (HES&S) and Corporate Sustainability, who reports to the executive vice president of Operations, has leadership accountability for driving our corporate sustainability programs. This role provides the strategic focus necessary to align all areas of our corporate ESG strategy and embed sustainability practices into the way we run our business.

• Conversion of existing field gas pneumatic actuated controllers to instrument air or electric-action, permanently reducing methane emissions. Future devices installed on Marathon Oil-owned equipment will be instrument air or electric-action.
• Purchase of renewable energy credits (RECs) to fully offset 2021 Scope 2 emissions created from purchased electricity use.
• Improved gas capture.
• Optimization of compression associated with gas lift

""Driving significant and continuous reductions to our GHG emissions intensity is a core part of our strategy to mitigate the longer-term market risks related to climate change. Our GHG reduction initiatives are supported by transparent, quantitative objectives intended to promote accountability and ingenuity throughout our organization. We believe that our 2025 Scope 1 and 2 goal is more ambitious than the emissions reduction trajectory necessary to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.""

""We report our direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2) as defined by the IPIECA/API/IOGP Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions on an operated basis. We calculate Scope 1 direct emissions from U.S. facilities using EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Reporting Rule.

We believe strong corporate governance is foundational to delivering shareholder value, and have modified our executive compensation framework to further align management interests with stakeholders’ interests and to incentivize the behaviors we believe are most important:
• Safety
• GHG emissions intensity reduction
• Capital discipline
• Enterprise breakeven
• Balance sheet/financial performance
In recognition of the importance of these behaviors, several actions were taken related to executive officer compensation. Executive officers saw their base salaries reduced by 10% during 2020 in response to the severe market conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and for 2021, the company reduced annual board compensation by 25% and my total direct compensation by 25% including a 35% reduction to my long-term incentive awards",Yes,No conditions specified,,,No,Yes (unspecified),"""Announced a goal for 2025 to reduce GHG intensity by more than 50% relative to a 2019 baseline. We identified multiple operational and design solutions to achieve this goal, including but not limited to continued replacement of instrument gas pneumatic controllers with lower or non-emitting technologies, connecting additional sites to utility power where feasible and investing in soil carbon sequestration to offset emissions.""

""One example of a beneficial collaboration is our support for soil carbon sequestration by funding a credit development project with Grassroots Carbon, formerly Soil Value Exchange. 
The organization is focused on unlocking the massive carbon storage potential of sustainably grazed pasture and rangelands, which cover over one third of the U.S. and represent an important ecosystem. Marathon Oil’s purchase of verified agricultural soil carbon storage credits through Grassroots Carbon will directly benefit U.S. ranchers who practice regenerative grazing techniques that draw carbon from the atmosphere and restore soil health. This method has the additional benefits of preserving or improving local biodiversity, the soil’s water retention in arid regions, and the quality of water in the watersheds where it’s utilized.
Marathon Oil is interested in using high-quality nature-based carbon credits where they make sense. The Grassroots Carbon credits will be certified under the new BCarbon standard, a scalable soil carbon storage standard designed to work for landowners and carbon storage buyers. In order to deliver soil carbon storage credits of the highest quality, Grassroots Carbon will utilize an internationally-recognized
soil measurement methodology as well as BCarbon’s independent verification and certification requirements.""",,,5100000000,,Fossil Fuels,,2000,,,,

operations and to the ways in which
we design and create new places in
partnership with our supply chain.
We want to play a full role in addressing
this global challenge and believe it
is the right thing to do for all of our
stakeholders. ","In December 2020, we received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its science-based targets (SBTs) to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:

Berkeley Group commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by FY2030 from a FY2019 base year.
Berkeley Group also commits to reduce scope 3 purchased goods and services and use of sold products GHG emissions 40% per square foot of legally completed floor area over the same timeframe.
These targets represent an ambitious step forward in our approach to tackling climate change and have been calculated to ensure that we play our part in limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

To ensure that we achieve our targets, our focus is on the following:

Reducing gas oil, natural gas and electricity consumption across our construction sites, offices and sales suites (scope 1 and 2 target). Particular emphasis will be placed on minimising or eliminating gas oil usage through the implementation of more fuel efficient plant and its substitution with biodiesels; measures that have been trialled by Berkeley during 2019/20.
Undertaking embodied carbon assessments and working with our supply chain to reduce impact across the most prominent areas (scope 3 target).
Continuing to improve the fabric efficiency of our homes and incorporating low carbon technologies (scope 3 target). We will also look to monitor the in-use performance of our homes to help drive further improvements.
In addition to the above, we continue to procure 100% renewable electricity backed by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) for its UK construction site, office and sales suite activities. This is an action that has been in place since May 2017, along with offsetting our remaining emissions from our direct operations through verified projects to be carbon neutral, which continues on an annual basis.",,https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/media/pdf/f/2/11699_001_Climate_Action_Brochure_A5_v5.pdf,Not Specified,,,,,Yes,Yes,Partial,No,,No,,Annual reporting,No,No,,Yes,No conditions specified,,,No,No,"Our first priority is to reduce our
emissions, but until we complete this
transition we will continue to balance
our impacts by investing in projects and
partnerships that produce zero carbon
energy or actively remove carbon from
the atmosphere.
We will maintain carbon neutral direct
business operations (Scopes 1 & 2)
through purchasing verified carbon
offsets, as well as investigating
opportunities to deliver or support
nature-based carbon capture and
renewable energy initiatives.
ACTIONS
• Carbon neutral – we will continue to
be carbon neutral within our operations
(covering Scope 1 and Scope 2
emissions) through purchasing 100%
renewable energy in the UK (backed by
Energy Guarantee of Origins) and then
offset our remaining emissions through
the support of verified projects
• Innovation – we will investigate
the opportunity for innovation and
partnerships that would help us to
utilise meanwhile uses to generate
clean energy and to explore how
carbon offsets can deliver nature-based
solutions and support nature’s recovery",,,2800000000,,Infrastructure,,2664,,,,
